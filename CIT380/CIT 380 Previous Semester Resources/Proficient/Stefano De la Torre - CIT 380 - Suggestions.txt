CIT380 - Suggestions.

If students are approached without being guided, they will get lost. The different structure is good, but it takes a little while to get there.
A suggestions is to approach the questions that prove why the current structure that students might be expecting is not the best approach. Then explain how like a buffet not everyone needs or wants the same things, but since all is for the same price, the best they can do is to take as much as they can, but only what they are going to finish, otherwise they might waste time on something they can't progress and then miss the oportunity to get to what they need the most.


Suggestion to list projects they know about, then ask what are the similarities, and from that asking what makes it a project.
Ask to pick a project and then confirm the scale or alter it to fit on the constrain of a semster's time.
